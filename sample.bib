We studied developers testing behavior inside the Pharo community in the purpose to improve it. In this paper, we take inspiration from a paper of the literature to enhance our comprehension of test habits in our open source community. We report results of a field study on how often the developers use tests in their daily practice, whether they make use of tests selection and why they do. Results are strengthened by interviews with developers involved in the study. The main findings are that developers run tests every modifications of their code they did; most of the time they practice test selection (instead of launching an entire test suite); however they are not accurate in their selection; they change their selection depending on the duration of the tests and; contrary to expectation, test selection is not influenced by the size of the test suite.},

  abstract = {With the generalization of mobile devices and Web applications, GUI frameworks evolve at a fast pace: JavaFX replaced Swing, Angular 8 replaced Angular 1.4 which had replaced Google Web Toolkit (GWT). This situation forces organizations to migrate their applications to modern frameworks regularly so they do not become obsolete. There has been research in the past on automatic GUI migration. However, and concurrently, large organisations' applications use many different technologies. For example, the IT company with which we are working, Berger-Levrault, wishes to migrate applications written in generic programming language (Java/GWT), proprietary "4th generation" languages (VisualBasic 6, PowerBuilder), or markup languages (Silverlight). Furthermore, one must expect that in a few years time, new frameworks will appear and new migrations will be required. Thus, there is a need for a language-agnostic migration approach allowing one to migrate various legacy GUI to the latest technologies. None of the existing solutions allow to deal with such a variety of GUI framework. They also typically focus on a subpart of the migration (i.e. how to extract a specific GUI framework) ignoring the re-engineering/forward-engineering part of the migration (which is straightforward for a single technology). This makes it difficult to adapt these solutions to other GUI frameworks. We propose an approach to migrate the GUI part of applications. It is based on meta-models to represent the visual element structure and layout. We detail how to create both the GUI extractors and generators, with guidelines to support new markup and programming languages. We evaluate our approach by implementing three extractors and generators for web-based or desktop-based user interfaces defined with generic programming languages (Java, Pharo, TypeScript) or markup languages (XML, HTML). We comment case studies on five applications, opened and closed source, of different sizes. The implementations of our generic approach detect 99\% of the widgets and identify (i.e. determine the type of the widget) 97\% of them. We give examples of the migrated GUIs, both successful and not.},

  abstract = {Berger-Levrault is an international company that developed applications in GWT for more than 10 years. However, GWT is no longer actively maintained, with only one major update since 2015. To avoid being stuck with legacy technology, the company decided to migrate its applications to Angular. However, because of the size of the applications (more than 500 web pages per application), rewriting from scratch is not desirable. To ease the migration, we designed a semi-automated migration approach that helps developers migrate applications' front-end from GWT to Angular and a tool that performs the migration. In this paper, we present our approach and tool. We validated the approach on concrete application migration and compared its benefits to redeveloping the application manually. We report that the semi-automated migration offers an effort reduction over a manual migration. Finally, we present recommendations for future migration projects.},

  abstract = {In a collaboration with Berger-Levrault, a major IT company, we are working on the migration of GWT applications to Angular. We focus on the GUI aspect of this migration which requires a framework switch (GWT to Angular) and a programming language switch (Java to TypeScript). Previous work identified that the GUI can be split into the UI structure and the GUI behavioral code. GUI behavioral code is the code executed when the user interacts with the UI. Although the migration of UI structure has already been studied, the migration of the GUI behavioral code has not. To help developers during the migration of their applications, we propose a generic approach in four steps that uses a meta-model to represent the GUI behavioral code. This approach includes a separation of the GUI behavioral code into events (caller code) and the code executed when an event is fired (called code). We present the approach and its implementation for a real industrial case study. The application comprises 470 Java (GWT) classes representing 56 web pages. We give examples of the migrated code. We evaluate the quality of the generated code with standard tools (SonarQube, codelizer) and compare it to another Java to TypeScript converter. The results show that our code has 53\% fewer warnings and rule violations for SonarQube, and 99\% fewer for codelizer.},

  abstract    = {Migrating large monolithic systems to service-based architecture is a complex process, mainly due to the difficulty of extracting reusable functionality from tightly coupled components. To support this, Service Identification techniques have been proposed to decompose monoliths into service candidates. Implementing these service candidates requires significant restructuring efforts. To address this complexity and build confidence in the target architecture, prior research recommends using an incremental migration approach where services are extracted one at a time. However, incremental migration has been poorly explored in the literature and lacks dedicated tool support. Thus, we explore the idea of a tool-assisted service extraction to support incremental migration, where one service is extracted at each increment. This paper first discusses the challenges associated with incremental migration. Then, it presents a model-based extraction approach aimed at automatically extracting functionality as a service. The approach is supported by a tool prototype evaluated on an industrial system and an open-source project. Our results show that our tool can extract standalone services that are successfully invoked by a reduced version of the monolith.}

  abstract = {Software systems consume about 6\% of global energy, and new regulations promote energy efficiency. However, developers face challenges like standardized measurement tools, integrating energy monitoring, and interpreting data meaningfully, which hinders informed decisions balancing energy efficiency and performance metrics. While most studies focus on small-scale projects, we addressed this gap with an industrial case study. We developed a methodology to assess energy impact using Dynatrace Carbon Impact and NeoLoad, enabling the evaluation of technology-driven design decisions under production-like conditions. This enabled the evaluation of technology-driven design decisions, such as frontend frameworks (Java Swing vs. Angular), backend stacks (legacy Java vs. Spring Boot), and serialization formats (JSON vs. Protobuf) under production-like conditions. Our insights highlight several design recommendations for energy-efficient software in industrial contexts.}
